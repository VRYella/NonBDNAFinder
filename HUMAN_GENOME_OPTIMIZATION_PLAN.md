# NonBDNAFinder: Human Genome Scale Optimization Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis and improvement roadmap for optimizing NonBDNAFinder to work effectively with human genome-scale data (~3.2GB). Based on performance testing and code analysis, we identify key bottlenecks and propose multiple optimization approaches.

## Current Performance Analysis

### Baseline Performance (Current State)
- **Small sequences (988bp)**: 0.09 seconds, 144 motifs detected
- **10MB sequence**: >5 minutes (test timed out)
- **Current architecture**: Regex-based without Hyperscan, single-threaded
- **Memory efficiency**: Loads entire sequence into memory
- **Processing speed**: ~10 KB/s for large sequences

### Identified Bottlenecks
1. **Regex Performance**: Current fallback to regex for pattern matching
2. **Memory Management**: Full sequence loading without streaming
3. **Single-threaded Processing**: No parallelization at the detection level
4. **I/O Inefficiency**: Reading/writing large files without optimization
5. **Overlap Resolution**: Expensive post-processing step for large result sets

## Optimization Approaches

### Approach 1: High-Performance Pattern Matching Engine

#### Description

- **Memory Streaming**: Process chunks without loading entire genome

#### Implementation Strategy
```python
# Example configuration for human genome
config = ScanConfig(
    chunk_size=50_000_000,    # 50MB chunks
    overlap=10_000,           # 10KB overlap for motif boundaries
    max_workers=8,            # Use available CPU cores
    stream_results=True,      # Stream results to disk
    max_memory_mb=8000       # 8GB memory limit
)
```

- **Incremental Processing**: Process only changed regions
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed patterns

#### Implementation Strategy
```sql
-- Example database schema
CREATE TABLE genomic_sequences (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    chromosome VARCHAR(10),
    start_pos BIGINT,
    end_pos BIGINT,
    sequence TEXT,
    sequence_hash VARCHAR(64)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_genomic_position ON genomic_sequences 
USING GIST (chromosome, int8range(start_pos, end_pos));
```

#### Expected Performance
- **Initial indexing**: 2-4 hours
- **Subsequent queries**: <1 minute for targeted regions

    CPUScoreingStage(precision="high"),
    DatabaseStorageStage(index=True),
    OverlapResolutionStage(strategy="scientific_priority")
])
```

#### Expected Performance
- **Processing speed**: 1000+ MB/s (screening), 100+ MB/s (detailed)
- **Accuracy**: 99%+ precision with configurable sensitivity
- **Total time**: 1-5 minutes for full human genome
