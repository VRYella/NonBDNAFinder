"""
Enhanced overlap resolution system for Non-B DNA motif detection.

This module implements sophisticated algorithms for resolving overlapping motifs
within the same subclass based on scoring criteria and scientific logic.

Key Features:
- Score-based selection for overlapping motifs within same subclass
- Dynamic merging strategies based on motif types
- Integration with existing Hyperscan detection pipeline
- Configurable overlap thresholds and resolution strategies
