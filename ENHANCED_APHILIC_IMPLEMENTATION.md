# Enhanced A-philic DNA Detection Implementation

## Overview

This implementation successfully upgrades the A-philic DNA detection system using the sophisticated algorithm from `call_Aphilic.py` and integrates it with hyperscan for performance optimization.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Propensity Tables
- **Complete Tetra Table**: All 256 tetranucleotide combinations with log2-odds scores
- **Complete Tri Table**: All 64 trinucleotide combinations with log2-odds scores
- **Source**: Embedded propensity tables from the sophisticated `call_Aphilic.py` algorithm

### 2. Advanced Detection Algorithm
- **Nucleation Detection**: 10-nt windows with all positive tetra steps + tri-window cutoff
- **Extension Algorithm**: Kadane-variant to find best containing subarray
- **Step Scoring**: Combined tetra/tri scoring with weighted contributions (w4=0.7, w3=0.3)
- **Non-overlapping Selection**: Greedy selection by score for optimal regions

### 3. Hyperscan Integration
- **Performance Optimization**: Hyperscan database compilation for positive tetranucleotides
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation when hyperscan not available
- **Pattern Matching**: Efficient detection of A-philic anchor patterns

### 4. Enhanced Scoring Methodology
- **Normalized Scoring**: Length-constraint based normalization for fair comparison
- **Metadata Tracking**: Comprehensive metadata including algorithm details
- **Quality Metrics**: Position counts, nucleation peaks, and step statistics
